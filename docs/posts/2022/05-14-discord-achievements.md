## Secret Achievements

These Achievements have their Descriptions hidden until you unlock them.  
They are for the most party connected to the score.

    <h3>How to get it</h3>
    Be the 100th visitor on the "Party Mode" Tab.  
    Discord counts up by 1 for each user that visits the tab, so this can be a bit tricky to get. Just switch between "Party Mode" and another tab quickly.
    
    ??? warning "What happens when you click the Achievement"
        Unlocking the achievement allows you to click it. Doing so sends you to the "Never gonna give you up" Video, basically Rick-rolling you.
