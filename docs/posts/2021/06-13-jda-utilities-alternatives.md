# Alternatives for JDA-Utilities
JDA-Utilities[^1] is a library made for JDA[^2].  
Unfortunately has the library entered a state of not being updated nor maintained anymore. While core-parts still function fine is the library lacking a lot of features that would make it better in the long run.

This page attempts to list all known alternatives for (parts) of JDA-Utilities.  
If you know an alternative that isn't listed here, let me know in the JDA-Discord[^3], so that I can update this page.

!!! warning "Note"
    The list is in **no particular order**.  
    The position of an entry does not evaluate into how good or bad it actually is.

## JDA-Commands
https://github.com/rainestormee/jda-command

A Command Library for JDA.
