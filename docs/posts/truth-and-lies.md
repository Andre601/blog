# Truth and Lies
There have been several posts and claims regarding PayPal where they are "banning the selling of products related to Minecraft" which isn't true at all, but I'll talk about why in a bit.

## How did this start?
This started (or at least became more popular) when Songoda, a group of plugin developers under Brianna, owner of Songoda, has been banned by PayPal. They announced this on their Discord and made the claim there, which caused an outrage from fans but also some developers as they now feared to lose a possible income if not even their PayPal account.  
The majority of developers and the majority of the community however made the right thing, which was to contact both PayPal and Mojang over various methods to request some clarification. On both ends did they receive the response, that those claims aren't true and are fabricated.

## Phone calls
To "proof" that they are right did Songoda later post a recording of a supposed Phonecall with a PayPal-Employee, where he confirmed their claims.  
However, as many stated is there no real indicator about if the person on the other hand was actually a employee or not just a random person, and they put it away as a hoax.

## The aftermath
A few months later did the above got fired up again, when different developers reported that they have been banned by PayPal.  
As in the other case were those devs extremely vague about the actual reason and because of PayPal not mentioning a clear reason was it promptly assumed, that PayPal is indeed banning people that sell products related to Minecraft.  
But just as before was there no clear evidence to support this. This however didn't stop people to create thread after thread, demanding from Spigot to "Treat developers fairly" or to add a new payment option, without doing actual fact-checking first.

There was even a Change.org petition made to demand a change, while the people completely forget the facts.

## The actual Facts
To finally give some light on all of this, will I now list all the actual and proofen facts about recent events and similar.

### Fact 1: PayPal never stated a clear ban reason
There never was any clear evidence where PayPal gave a clear and understandable reason, that they actually banned people for selling Products related to Minecraft.  
The developers in questions have a questionable/shade history for the most part, which makes the likelyhood, that they have been banned for things like abusing PayPal's Chargeback/Refund-System (issuing $0.01 refunds), a lot more plausible.

### Fact 2: Spigot's bans are justified
Some people complained about Spigot banning specific people, this however was mainly because those people received invalid/fabricated information about Spigot acting like a dictatorship, where in fact they had actual valid reasons for the bans.  
Kangarko is a prime example, as he send out a mail about a blog-post where he claimed that "Spigot was dead" where md_5 himself had to step in and make a post to adress those blatant claims.

### Fact 3: New Payment options won't solve anything
Multiple people demanded more payment options such as Stripe or even Crypto-currency as it would make things more easy.  
The truth is the exact oposite. Services like Stripe still require an age-verification including an ID to create and use an account and not everyone wants to have a separate account just for purchaseing resources.  
Cryptocurrency wouldn't help either and could even be a benefit for devs to scam off buyers (Making a $0.01 refund to remove the buyer from list) which would cause moderation actions from Spigot's end.

### Fact 4: Spigot doesn't owe you anything
Some posts where written in a way where the Author really demanded from Spigot to do what they want. Their supposed reasons behind this is, that popular devs bring traffic and money to Spigot which couldn't be further from the truth.  
While it is true that popular plugins can bring traffic does this not directly translate into more money.  
None of the premium resources sold bring Spigot any revenue as they only provide the payment-option but not handle the payment itself. They make 0 money from you selling plugins and even more do they give you this oportunity for free.

Spigot givey you the option to upload resources (free or premium), write posts, use their resource API for things like update-checks, download and use their Software (Spigot, BungeeCord) and use those to make a server(-network) and earn money with it and that all for FREE. At the very end are YOU the one who should owe them something as they give a lot of things for free without any real benefit in the end.

## Final words
I hope this post helps you to understand the current situation a bit better. For the future, make sure to second-guess claims made by people and don't just blindly trust those. It's in your benefit and the benefit of others to not make lies spread and cause drama.
