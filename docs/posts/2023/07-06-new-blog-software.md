This post marks a significant change in my Blogging website. Because it uses a new software provided by the Material for MkDocs theme.

<!-- more -->

## What changed

The most noticable change should be visible on the left side (If you're on PC that is): A sidebar showing author and post information such as date of post, category and estimated read time.

## Other changes

With this came some other changes... Namely:

- The "Posts" tab is gone as the blog has been moved to the main index page.
- The "Reviews tab was removed due to not being used at all.
- URLs of posts have changed. There are **no** redirects for the old URL (Redirect plugin refuses to work for me).

## Feedback and bug reports

Please give feedback on this change and also provide bug reports if you find any broken links or similar.
