I on my part go with second option as I myself received a \"newsletter\" I never signed up for from him, which constantly was about MA. I never signed up for MA and wondered why I suddenly got mails from that Domain. My thought imediatally went towards his old course that I signed up for (Yes I know. I regret this decision to this day).</p> <p>He for sure used the e-mails of all the buyers from his old course to advertise his new one, even if they never were interested3. Only after I contacted him and requested removal of my e-mail from the newsletter was it removed and the reason for why I got those mails provided: Their ToS apparently makes you agree to subscribe to it(?) This can't and probably isn't legal. There is a reason why pretty much every site has a checkbox about whether you want to subscribe to their newsletter or not, when you register an account, as it sure has legal reasons. An end-user (you) needs a clear way to (un)subscribe to the newsletter or at least a clear info that you subscribe to one which Kangarko didn't provide.

His response was signed with \"Legal Team MA\" while the mail itself was send from his personal MA-Mail account.</p> <p>So either the Legal Team uses his account or he claims to be a Legal Team/attourney, which he most likely isn't.

While I do encourage Freedom of Speech, since I myself aren't shy about saying what I think, is this not the case here. This was a blatant copy and paste of a review I made without and transformation of it which could've put it under Fair Use. It was just copied and then pasted onto his site as a post. No real attempt was made to comunicate at any point, that he may use your reviews on unrelated sites without asking. Nowhere on his plugin pages is stuff like this mentioned which is a disgusting thing to do and only serves as a way for him to pad the \"ratings\" on his site, which isn't even related about MA at all. 99% of all reviews there come from his plugins here on Spigot and therefore don't represent MA itself. In addition did he also use DMs as \"ratings\" which is even more subjective and unrelated as they clearly don't give back an accurate rating for anything.</p> <p>I really recommend to you to quickly google your name with names of his plugins to see if you pop up on MA as a result. If you do and you never got asked if it is okay to share this review outside of SpigotMC, go and request the imediate removal of the post through contacting him on his support E-Mail.

One of them being the whitelisted intents. It makes sense that you want to put sensitive intents behind a whitelist to not willingly give sensitive data to bots that could abuse it.</p> <p>The issue is that small bots still can access priviledged intents and data without the whitelisting. While this makes sense for bots that are only on a hand full of servers and are used for things like moderation is it not really covering the data from being exploited. While some of you may think that 100 servers isn't that much should you always remember that a server may have hundreds if not even thousands of individual members. This could end up in the bot having access to thousands of individual members without needing whitelisting for the intent to begin with.</p> <p>I'm not the biggest fan of the priviledged intents, since they caused my bot to lose a few very valuable features in the process, but if you really want to keep this should the intent requirement perhaps be lowered to like 50 servers as no person in the world has a private bot on over 100 servers. At such a point would it be a public bot already.</p> <p>The next problem is Discord's reason of \"privacy\". I remember Discord mentioning that the intents were restricted to prevent spam bots or data farms (Sites that collect and display user information without consent) from getting such information that easy. While this may be a good point, the fact that this only applies to bots makes it essentially pointless. Sites which collect data without consent of the users often don't use bots, but instead automated user accounts to do so, and as a result can collect the info without any restrictions because the Discord client does have the required intents to work properly.</p> <p>In addition, \"small\" bots can still do damage with those intents. How else do you explain the existence of all those \"Free nitro\" and \"Free server boosts\" bots?</p> <p>Finally, a bot is not infallible and can be hijacked at any moment. Yes, it may be unlikely, but it is not impossible, and if the bot is on several thousands of servers AND also has access to the intents could nobody predict what exploits could be done with the data received.

When we, however, take a look at JetBrains Partner page3 and search for either his course, the old name he had before, his commonly used name (Kangarko) or his real name (Matej) can we find absolutely nothing. I've reached out to JetBrains to see if there is any evidence that he is in fact an official partner with them, but other than a confirmation that they will investigate it, did I not get any answer so far.</p> <p>Other bold claims he makes are for example the \"2,000+ students\" and \"900+ reviews\". First of all is a large number not automatically a good thing. By that logic would Aids or even Corona be the best thing ever, but look where we are right now. Especially when we talk about reviews. From those 900+ reviews could only like half of it be good and the remainder could be a bad rating or sarcastic 5-star reviews. But knowing from personal experience that he likes to use reviews from his plugins4 would I believe that not even half of those reviews are actual legit ones.</p>","tags":["spigotmc","spigot","kangarko"]},{"location":"posts/2021/11-22-dont-trust-kangarko/#why-do-i-bother","title":"Why do I bother?","text":"<p>Now the question: Why do I even care that much?

It should just be a normal item with a special texture and no real feature.</p> <p>It's a good idea to first create the necessary folders for the textures and files to use. In my example will I use the name <code>myitem</code> as the namespace to use. This means that the folder structures may look like this:</p> <pre><code>data/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 items_packs/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 myitem/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 resource_pack/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 myitem/\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see do we create new folders called <code>myitem</code> inside <code>items_packs</code> and <code>resource_pack/assets/</code>. The reason why <code>resource_pack</code> has it inside the <code>assets</code> folder is, that MC is always checking <code>assets/:namespace/</code> for textures, models and similar when any given path is prefixed with a namespace (i.e. <code>myitem:some/path</code>).</p> <p>The next step I usually do is to first add the assets. In our case would it just be a PNG file of the item. In this example am I calling it <code>dummy.png</code>.</p> <p>Since it is a texture will we need to add a <code>textures</code> folder inside the <code>assets/myitem/</code> directory, as MC checks <code>assets/:namespace/textures/</code> for any texture file. For better organisation will I also add an extra <code>item/</code> folder to it. This means, that the new structure is like this:</p> <pre><code>data/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 items_packs/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 myitem/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 resource_pack/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 myitem/\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 textures/\n                \u2514\u2500\u2500 item/\n                    \u2514\u2500\u2500 dummy.png\n</code></pre> <p>Pro-tips</p> <ul> <li>Keep file and folder names lowercased. Minecraft doesn't like uppercased names that much.</li> <li>You can always use extra folders inside the textures folder to further organize your files. Just make sure to also adjust any texture paths used.</li> </ul> <p>Now with this completed is the next step to actually tell ItemsAdder to add it as a new item. To do this, I create a new YAML file inside <code>items_packs/myitem/</code>. Any name for the file works, but it should be kept lowercase and not contain any spaces or weird characters.</p> <p>To keep it simple will I name it <code>dummy.yml</code> and fill it with the following:</p> dummy.yml<pre><code>info:\nnamespace: myitem # (1)\nitems:\ndummy: # (2)\ndisplay_name: \"Dummy Item\" # (3)\nresource:\nmaterial: PAPER # (4)\ngenerate: true # (5)\ntextures: # (6)\n- 'item/dummy.png'\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>This is used as the custom namespace for ItemsAdder commands such as <code>/iaget</code> but also other things</li> <li>This can be any name. Just make sure it's lowercased. It will be used as identifier for the custom item (i.e. <code>myitem:dummy</code>)</li> <li>The name that will be displayed when obtaining the item.</li> <li>The Base item that is used. ItemsAdder will assign a custom model data for the item to override the texture/model. This has to be a valid Minecraft item.</li> <li><code>generate: true</code> tells ItemsAdder to auto-generate the necessary model file for this item. This should be used if you're not using a custom model.</li> <li>This sets the textures to use. For a normal item is only one texture needed, but blocks can have up to 6 (One for each side). The path is relative to <code>assets/:namespace/textures/</code>.</li> </ol> <p>With this setup am I telling ItemsAdder to create a new entry for the item PAPER with the texture located at <code>assets/myitem/textures/</code>.

Instead are there multiple servers (so called instances) that communicate with each other, building a network. This has the benefit that this service or site isn't under the control of one individual and can't be shut down so easily. If one instance is blocked/shut down, several others continue to exist. Or to put it even more simply: Federation puts control into the hand of the people and not just a single person.</p> <p>Mastodon is using this concept.

For accounts that are on the same instance is it relative easy: Go to their account page and press the \"Follow\" button.</p> <p>Accounts on other instances tho are a little bit more tricky, but not that much. First, find out on what instance they have their account. This can for once be checked through their tag.

If, for example, you want to follow the <code>Mastodon</code> account on <code>mastodon.social</code> would the full tag be <code>@Mastodon@mastodon.social</code>. To now follow the user, copy the tag and append it to the URL of the instance you use. If the instance would be <code>example.com</code>, would the URL be <code>example.com/@Mastodon@mastodon.social</code>. This will now show the profile through your instance, allowing you to easily follow it.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>A user can set that follows need to be accepted by them first, before you can see their public posts in your feed.</p> <p>It's important to note that you can only see public posts from people you follow in your personal timeline.
