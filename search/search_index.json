This post is not an official post by SpigotMC. I do not claim that I am or was a Staff Member of the Spigot team and also don't claim that this post is endorsed by Spigot. I just want to support SpigotMC against the constant attacks they get from fanboys of devs who can't accept the mistakes they made and the consequences. I do NOT intent to create yet another fight here, but rather want to put some light on who Kangarko really is and what shady/illegal tactics he actually uses. Foreword and context \u00b6 Yesterday (20 th December 2020) was something happening. The former Spigot Member Kangarko has been banned for the continued breaking of the forum rules, most noticably advertising in places like plugin updates. Instead of banning him after the first few rule-breaks was the Spigot-Team forgiving and gave him multiple chances till now. Kangarko now send a mail towards multiple people, claiming that Spigot is now \"dead\" and that they would pretty much act like a dictatorship now, banning people if they do things like selling their resources on other sites. @md_5 made a post debunking those blatant claims 1 and (yet again) defending SpigotMC and the team from people that believe a developer's claims without second thoughts. Kangarko is mostly known for his ChatControl Plus plugin alongside other plugins. He also made online courses which are hated and loved by various people (I hate them tbh). But this is only the surface of who he really is. Behind this facade is he constantly abusing various things to his advantage in the hope of earning money. I make this post here to now list all the wrong-doings of him and why you shouldn't trust him any longer, especially regarding Spigot. For multiple reasons, including to not give Kangarko free publicity, will I use \"MA\" to reference the site he owns, where he offers \"courses\" about programming plugins and such. Point 1: Abuse of the resource system and his plugins \u00b6 Kangarko was banned for breaking the rules, but which ones exactly? He for sure broke the rules about abusing the Update system for resources to promote sites/services outside of SpigotMC, in his case those courses I mentioned earlier. I, at one point, even directly complained about him constantly posting \"Promotions\" in his plugin updates 2 . But that wasn't all. He also posted those promotions in his own plugins! When the server started did you receive a nice little message in the console about his courses and the only way to disable this was a setting which wasn't easy to find. Note that this was before the rule about no ads in resource updates has become a thing and it's my personal headcanon that this behaviour of his was one of the main reasons why this rule was implemented. Point 2: Abusing Knowledge/Data \u00b6 Are you one of those people that received a mail from Kangarko (Matej) about the \"death of SpigotMC\" and wondered how he got your mail-adress? Well, he most likely got it through either PayPal (Looking at latest transactions) or even worse used the data of people he had from his very first (or the MA) courses to contact them. I on my part go with second option as I myself received a \"newsletter\" I never signed up for from him, which constantly was about MA. I never signed up for MA and wondered why I suddenly got mails from that Domain. My thought imediatally went towards his old course that I signed up for (Yes I know. I regret this decision to this day). He for sure used the e-mails of all the buyers from his old course to advertise his new one, even if they never were interested 3 . Only after I contacted him and requested removal of my e-mail from the newsletter was it removed and the reason for why I got those mails provided: Their ToS apparently makes you agree to subscribe to it(?) This can't and probably isn't legal. There is a reason why pretty much every site has a checkbox about whether you want to subscribe to their newsletter or not, when you register an account, as it sure has legal reasons. An end-user (you) needs a clear way to (un)subscribe to the newsletter or at least a clear info that you subscribe to one which Kangarko didn't provide. At least that's my basic knowledge about the legal system. Point 3: Abuse of reviews \u00b6 I yesterday discovered through a google search (Searched for \"ChatControl Pro Andre_601\" to find an old discussion I linked above) that a fairly old review of mine about ChatControl Pro has been posted on the MA site 4 . It since then got removed as I requested the immediate removal of this post as I at no point gave the permission to Kangarko to use my review for whatever. His response was signed with \"Legal Team MA\" while the mail itself was send from his personal MA-Mail account. So either the Legal Team uses his account or he claims to be a Legal Team/attourney, which he most likely isn't. I don't claim to be one either, but I know that the response he gave regarding my reviews existance on the MA Site is basically wrong in more than one way 5 . In my mail did I request the imediate removal of the review and possibly any other review associated with my account from his site, as this was made without my aknowledgment and/or permission to do so, which at the very least can be seen as breaking laws about privacy. In his response does he give reasons such as \"Freedom of Speech\". While I do encourage Freedom of Speech, since I myself aren't shy about saying what I think, is this not the case here. This was a blatant copy and paste of a review I made without and transformation of it which could've put it under Fair Use. It was just copied and then pasted onto his site as a post. No real attempt was made to comunicate at any point, that he may use your reviews on unrelated sites without asking. Nowhere on his plugin pages is stuff like this mentioned which is a disgusting thing to do and only serves as a way for him to pad the \"ratings\" on his site, which isn't even related about MA at all. 99% of all reviews there come from his plugins here on Spigot and therefore don't represent MA itself. In addition did he also use DMs as \"ratings\" which is even more subjective and unrelated as they clearly don't give back an accurate rating for anything. I really recommend to you to quickly google your name with names of his plugins to see if you pop up on MA as a result. If you do and you never got asked if it is okay to share this review outside of SpigotMC, go and request the imediate removal of the post through contacting him on his support E-Mail. He HAS to remove it as it is YOUR review and therefore belongs to you or at the very least to SpigotMC. Conclusion \u00b6 I hope this rather long post convinces you about who Kangarko really is behind his plugins and that you won't blindly follow him and believe all the things he says.

How did this start? \u00b6 This started (or at least became more popular) when Songoda, a group of plugin developers under Brianna, the owner of Songoda, has been banned by PayPal. They announced this on their Discord and made the claim there, which caused an outrage from fans but also some developers as they now feared to lose a possible income if not even their PayPal account. The majority of developers and the majority of the community however made the right thing, which was to contact both PayPal and Mojang over various methods like social-media (Twitter) or E-Mail to request some clarification. On both ends did they receive the response, that those claims aren't true and are fabricated. Statement by Mojang/Microsoft (Provided by MrDienns) Hey! Got an update on this - the team that handles enforcement isn't aware of PayPal enforcing any of Mojang's specific rules, and said that it's highly unlikely that they would be looking at specific transactions or the content associated with them. They certainly haven't worked together at least, so it seems like whatever PayPal is taking action against is something only PayPal has an issue with. There's nothing in there [a plugin from a banned author] that looks to break our rules either. This is solely on PayPal unfortunately, although it sounds like they're not giving much explanation? In addition does Mojang's EULA and commercial Guidelines even allow the distribution and selling of plugins 1 . Phone calls \u00b6 To \"proof\" that they are right did Songoda later post a recording of a supposed Phonecall with a PayPal-Employee, where he confirmed their claims. However, as many stated is there no real indicator about if the person on the other hand was actually a employee or not just a random person, and they put it away as a hoax. The aftermath \u00b6 A few months later did the above got fired up again, when different developers reported that they have been banned by PayPal. As in the other case were those devs extremely vague about the actual reason and because of PayPal not mentioning a clear reason was it promptly assumed, that PayPal is indeed banning people that sell products related to Minecraft. But just as before was there no clear evidence to support this. This however didn't stop people to create thread after thread, demanding from Spigot to \"Treat developers fairly\" 2 or to add a new payment option 3 , without doing actual fact-checking first. There was even a Change.org petition 4 made to demand a change, while the people completely forget the facts. The actual Facts \u00b6 To finally give some light on all of this, will I now list all the actual and proofen facts about recent events and similar. Fact 1: PayPal never stated a clear ban reason \u00b6 There never was any clear evidence where PayPal gave a clear and understandable reason, that they actually banned people for selling Products related to Minecraft. The developers in questions have a questionable/shady history for the most part, which makes the likelyhood, that they have been banned for things like abusing PayPal's Chargeback/Refund-System (issuing $0.01 refunds), a lot more plausible. In addition do large plugin developers like Maximvdw have no issues whatsoever despite selling large amounts of plugins. 5 Fact 2: Bans are justified for the most part \u00b6 Some people complained about Spigot or PayPal banning specific people without any valid reason(s) for it. This however was mainly because those people received invalid/fabricated information about Spigot and/or PayPal where they claim invalid reasons to make themself look like the victim, while in reality the ban was justified. Here is a list of (recently) banned people and their known ban-reason. Kangarko Banned from SpigotMC for constant inapropriate advertising (i.e. in recource updates). He later even send a mass-mail about a blog-post he made titled \"Death of Spigot\" 6 for which md_5 had to make an official statement about the situation. 7 GC. Ban reason on PayPal unknown Ome_R Actual ban reason on PayPal is unknown, but he has issued several $0.01 refunds. While most of them where often to remove Leakers was at least one of those refunds out of frustration and hate. 8 He later on apologized for this horrible mistake he made. 9 GhastB Banned from PayPal for being underaged (15-16 years old). 10 He claims to have the parental approval but didn't provide any clear cut evidence to support this. Additionally was this user associated with Songoda (Sold products on their site) which at least gets you limited by PayPal. Finally are there also rumors about him creating false businesses 11 which for sure would be a valid reason. Whether this is true or not is up to debate. Fact 3: New Payment options won't solve everything \u00b6 Multiple people demanded more payment options such as Stripe or even Crypto-currency as it would make things more easy. While payment options like Stripe would indeed offer options such as buying products with only a debit-card and no account, would it still offer potential issues and risks, such as that minors could easly spend large amounts of money without parental supervision, while PayPal has a requirement to either be of the age of maturity or have your parents permission and supervision. Cryptocurrency was another suggested alternative, mostly for privacy and availability. The downside of those would be higher fees for payments and possibly higher moderation work on Spigot's end as anonymity could also be a ground for possible scam. Fact 4: Spigot doesn't owe you anything \u00b6 Some posts where written in a way where the Author really demanded from Spigot to do what they want. Their supposed reasons behind this is, that popular devs bring traffic and money to Spigot which couldn't be further from the truth. While it is true that popular plugins can bring traffic does this not directly translate into more money. None of the premium resources sold bring Spigot any revenue as they only provide the payment-option but not handle the payment itself. They make 0 money from you selling plugins and even more do they give you this oportunity for free. Spigot gives you the option to upload resources (free or premium), write posts, use their resource API for things like update-checks, download and use their Software (Spigot, BungeeCord) and use those to make a server(-network) and earn money with it and that all for FREE. At the very end are YOU the one who should owe them something as they give a lot of things for free without any real benefit in the end. Final words and Credits \u00b6 I hope this post helps you to understand the current situation a bit better. For the future, make sure to second-guess claims made by people and don't just blindly trust those. It's in your benefit and the benefit of others to not make lies spread and cause drama.

Almost 200,000 servers are modded Minecraft Servers from which almost 46% are Spigot (~70,000 server) 2 . With that said do the Forum and Software have a lot of negative things, that annoys developers, server owners and forum users alike for quite some time now. To bring some light to this do I now list both positive and negative things about SpigotMC. Note In this post will I only list Pros and Cons about the Forum ! The Server software and API will be covered in a different Post. Pros \u00b6 Free resource distribution \u00b6 The forum allows anyone with an account to share their own resources. 3 No costs are bound to doing so. At most are there specific guidelines 4 and rules 5 you need to follow to not risk your resources to get removed. Many popular plugins became like that because they where shared on the forums and found a lot of exposure through it. Large Community \u00b6 The forum has a large Community all about Minecraft. No matter if it is about plugin development 6 , improving Server performance 7 or similar. The community is there and can more often than not give good advice to help. No P2W Features \u00b6 The forum doesn't offer any real rewards for donations that could be considered Pay2Win. You at most get the option to request a change of your name every so often, a badge and/or label as a sign of how much you donated at once/in total, and the option to change to a dark theme of the forum. While changing your name can be seen as a big feature, is it often not needed and only requires you to donate $5 which isn't that much. Cons \u00b6 Outdated Forum Software \u00b6 Spigot uses v1 of XenForo, which while working is not the most up to date version to use. This is shown by the fact that the forum has a lot of limiting factors. XenForo 2, the current main version of XenForo, offers a ton of QOL changes and features, that Spigot requires add-ons for to have. An update to the newer software would be positive, but obviously would break stuff and therefore requires a lot of maintenance to fix, not to mention that you would need to pay for a new license. Weak rule enforcement \u00b6 The forum staff often does not enforce the rules like they should be. A good example is the premium plugin Wormholes. According to the Premium Resource Guidelines will a plugin that didn't receive an update within 6 months get moved to the InactiveResource 8 account of the forum. If it then doesn't get any updates for another 6 months will it be permanently deleted. In our example was this never happening. The plugin, despite it having no updates since 2018 (2 years!), is still on the forum. It never was deleted or just put to the InactiveResource account as the Guidelines demand. Only after I made a public post about it was it now moved to the account. 9 No support for Premium Plugin Devs \u00b6 A big issue many developers have with Spigot is its lack in helping them protecting their Premium resources. Even more does the staff punish a dev, if they apply own measurements to protect their work, such as a license-system or obfuscation with not allowed types/methods. 10 Footnotes https://www.spigotmc.org \u21a9 https://bstats.org/global/bukkit \u21a9 https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ \u21a9 https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/31667/ (Only for premium resources) \u21a9 https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-rules/ \u21a9 https://www.spigotmc.org/forums/52/ https://www.spigotmc.org/forums/23/ \u21a9 https://www.spigotmc.org/forums/5/ \u21a9 https://www.spigotmc.org/members/20461/ \u21a9 https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/488104/ \u21a9 https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/420746/ \u21a9","title":"The Pros and Cons of SpigotMC"},{"location":"posts/2021/02-07-pros-and-cons-of-spigot/#pros","text":"","title":"Pros"},{"location":"posts/2021/02-07-pros-and-cons-of-spigot/#free-resource-distribution","text":"The forum allows anyone with an account to share their own resources. 3 No costs are bound to doing so.

With this term do I mean any kind of tool, app, software or other (non-)physical object a user might use. Since several years now am I a part of GitHub but also other places all around software. And many times do I get attacked for simply providing some form of critique towards something, because it's seen as hate. This post acts as my way to explain to you why my way of feedback may look aggressive but sure isn't. Honesty \u2260 Hate \u00b6 Whenever I give an honest opinion about a product (Such as my recent case with Renovatebot 1 ) do people start to see it as a personal attack, which I guarantee it isn't. The tone in which I talk about things may be a bit harsh or too honest for your taste, but believe me. When I would truly go aggressive towards you, would you not have a good day anymore. Trust me when I say that I don't want to hate your product, but instead want to share my experience with it so that you can improve on it. Wrong expectations \u00b6 I noticed more than once that some people have an attitude towards people like me, in which they blindly assume that I already know everything there is to know, to use their product. This can be anything: From reading and understanding the docs, to executing certain (advanced) commands in the terminal or similar. The truth is, that this is a faulty expectation. While it is normal to assume, that some products may require a bit more advanced levels of knowledge should you also always be ready for people that may need more help in understanding things. Take my previously mentioned case of Renovatebot. I never really used it before and was more used to Dependabot, which not only has a different, more simplified configuration file, but also doesn't offer any feature that Renovate does. On top of that does the docs, while detailed, not give a lot of cross-links to go to pages of interest in f.e. the \"Getting Started\" Guide 2 . Now take for comparison Material for MkDocs' Starting Guide 3 . On these docs do we have a lot of detailed explanations with links to various other pages to explain specific key-points in more detail. In addition does it have a more natural progression of difficulty: You start out with how to install the theme alongside MkDocs, then get an explanation on how to create your first page, followed by how to publish it. Only after that do they give you more advanced things such as how to customize the theme, but this is logical since it's now expected that you have the knowledge from the previous steps to progress. Always assuming that people have at least that level of knowledge, only to then act annoyed when someone askes more beginner-questions is not a good way to go. Take the critique and not hate it \u00b6 When I complain about things do I mean it in a sincere way. I do want to use your product and I do have interest in it, but I don't like it when I get forwarded to a documentation with only the bare-bone explanation done. You by now should've noticed it, but I have a bone to pick with Renovatebot. The way (one of) the maintainer(s) responded to me was kind of egoistic and in a way that (again) assumes I already know the more complicated parts of the bot. \"How do I ignore a specific Dependency?\" -> \" ignoreDeps \". This is one of the most lazy answers to pick. Yes, the docs explain ignoreDeps and I can search it up, but it still doesn't explain how the String needs to look like to ignore a specific dependency. Do I only set the package path? Do I set the artifact too? The way this answer was presented without any real context makes it much harder for me to understand and like this software. I do ask a lot of (admitedly) stupid questions, but this is all because of me trying to wrap my head around a topic. The way I understand and learn things is wastly different from what you and others may understand, so hating me because I critizise the documentation you have is in no way good. Try to take this critique and improve on it. Ask me what could be done better or link me to the docs if they're open source. All I want is to understand a product so that I won't have to ask at later points in my life. This is also one reason why I hate the \"Reputation-requirement\" on StackOverflow for even commenting on a question or answer... Seriously? How should people understand solutions if they can't even ask relevant questions towards the person giving the answer? This stops progress and is a huge waste because it causes duplicate questions to appear 4 . Final words \u00b6 With all this said do I hope you understand me now and that you won't react aggressive or priviledged when I ask stupid questions or give some harsh feedback. Again: All I want is to use your product in the future and for it to improve over time. Just reacting like I insulted your product AND your family on top of that and do actions like locking conversations (*stares at Renovatebot Maintainer*) is really not good and harms your reputation more than I ever could. After all is everything I want to have answers to my questions and some assistance. I'm often new to certain things and therefore need more help than others, so don't treat me like your worst enemy but rather like one who wants to improve and learn.

Bots are a wonderful thing on Discord. They can enhance and improve your Discord server and also protect it from harm. However, a bot isn't unfailable and security is only as save as the person managing it. Because of that is giving the Administrator permission to a bot one of if not even the most dangerous thing you can do. The same goes for asking for this permission in the OAuth2 invite or even relying on it to function. This Post will list my reasons about why you shouldn't give a bot Admin, or as the bot dev not ask for it in a Bot's invite, and what the common dangers are. Enjoy. Admin = All permissions without restrictions \u00b6 Description of Administrator Permission Members with this permission will have every permission and will also bypass all channel specific permissions or restrictions (for example, these members would get access to all private channels). This is a dangerous permission to grant. As mentioned in the description of the Administrator permission does it grant access to all permissions on a server and also bypasses any channel-specific perms and/or restrictions, allowing full read and write access to all channels on the server. Discord even mentions that this is in fact a dangerous permission to grant, yet bots get it on a daily basis for multiple reasons (which I explain later on in this post). With this permission could the bot do pretty much anything without anyone else being able to stop it, except for the owner and administrators which have a higher role. The only thing the bot can't do is delete the server as this is only doable by the Server owner themself. Bots are NOT safe! \u00b6 A Discord bot will NEVER be as safe as the dev claims. No matter how many times they mention how secure their bot is, will that not protect them from the biggest cause of errors: Being human. The bot's security is only as good as the people behind it. A unprotected eval-command, a leaked token or a hijacked account of the bot dev is enough for a malicious person to gain access to the bot and cause chaos towards the servers. And let's not forget that a developer may not always be a pure-of-heart person. They can at one point have a hate towards others. The fact is, that you should treat a Bot like a new user you never saw before and that randomly DMs you. Treat it carefully and don't just blindly trust it straight away. Or ask yourself this: What is easier for you to do when a bot went rogue? Just undoing the mass-bans the bot did. Undoing mass-bans, recreating deleted channels, changing back the server's name and icon, recreating all the roles you had, ... Administrator causes more harm than good in the long run. It may save you time, but at the cost of possibly getting your server nuked 2 at the end. Why do people give/ask for Administrator? \u00b6 If this permission is so dangerous, why do people give it to bots? And why do Bot-developers ask for it? Well, this can have different reasons, which I will cover some of here. Reason 1) Laziness \u00b6 By far the most common reason for this. Giving the Administrator permission is easy and saves time because you don't have to setup channel-specific permissions. In todays day and age do we try to save time wherever possible and setting up channel permissions is also no exception from this goal. To be fair is this also to partially blame on Discord's permission systems where a granting permission overrides denying ones, EVEN if the granting one is below the denying one. People want to spend as less time as possible in setting up permissions which is why they often just give whatever the bot askes for without questioning it. Reason 2) Bad role models \u00b6 Another cause of this are other bots, sites, services, etc. which are bad role models as they essentially tell you to do this. One bad role model is the popular Spigot plugin DiscordSRV 3 . In their Installation Guide 4 do they mention the following thing in the step \"Give the bot the discord permissions it needs to run\" 5 : Go to the Roles tab and create a new role. We've named ours Bot . Add the Administrator permission (or permissions listed below) to the new role. This has one major flaw, which is the laziness of people. As mentioned before are people lazy and often look for the way of the least effort to continue. And because of this will they often not bother scrolling to the permissions section and instead just give the Administrator one. Another more unrelated thing is, that they suggest you give the Mention @everyone, @here and All Roles permission which is simply stupid. Another bad role model are large bots. Bots such as Dyno, Rythm or Mee6 often ask for Administrator (Sometimes even with any other permission in existance) in their OAuth2 invite, which is more than questionable. Those bots encourage laziness because now you don't have to bother with the permissions as a whole. What can you do against this? \u00b6 You may now ask \"But what can/should I do against this?\" to which I have some answers. \"Duce Exemplum\" (Lead by Example) \u00b6 If you're a bot developer, stop asking for Administrator in your bot's invite. If people still give it was it their concious decition and you can't be blamed for their laziness here. If you REALLY want to do something good, force people to actually abandon the Administrator perm aproach by denying command-execution and similar while the bot has this particular permission 6 . You and your bot should be a role model to everyone. If you say you value safety and security, then lead by example and ask for the right permissions and not just Administrator. Think before granting \u00b6 You should always think first, if the bot actually needs those permissions. Does a Music bot really need View Audit Logs permissions? Can it work without it? What bare minimum permissions can a bot work with? What other perms are only benefits (i.e. custom emotes)? You should always think about what a bot really needs and not give it everything. Final Words \u00b6 Thank you for reading. I hope that by now you understand the possible dangers of the Administrator permission and why you should always think twice instead of blindly giving the permission to everyone and everything. And if you still don't think the perm is that dangerous, ask yourself this: Why would Discord themself mention that this is a dangerous permission to grant, if it isn't in your eyes? If they say it's dangerous, then it sure is!

Undoing mass-bans, recreating deleted channels, changing back the server's name and icon, recreating all the roles you had, ... Administrator causes more harm than good in the long run. It may save you time, but at the cost of possibly getting your server nuked 2 at the end.","title":"Bots are NOT safe!"},{"location":"posts/2021/09-28-bots-and-admin/#why-do-people-giveask-for-administrator","text":"If this permission is so dangerous, why do people give it to bots?

Giving the Administrator permission is easy and saves time because you don't have to setup channel-specific permissions. In todays day and age do we try to save time wherever possible and setting up channel permissions is also no exception from this goal. To be fair is this also to partially blame on Discord's permission systems where a granting permission overrides denying ones, EVEN if the granting one is below the denying one. People want to spend as less time as possible in setting up permissions which is why they often just give whatever the bot askes for without questioning it.","title":"Reason 1) Laziness"},{"location":"posts/2021/09-28-bots-and-admin/#reason-2-bad-role-models","text":"Another cause of this are other bots, sites, services, etc. which are bad role models as they essentially tell you to do this. One bad role model is the popular Spigot plugin DiscordSRV 3 . In their Installation Guide 4 do they mention the following thing in the step \"Give the bot the discord permissions it needs to run\" 5 : Go to the Roles tab and create a new role. We've named ours Bot . Add the Administrator permission (or permissions listed below) to the new role. This has one major flaw, which is the laziness of people. As mentioned before are people lazy and often look for the way of the least effort to continue. And because of this will they often not bother scrolling to the permissions section and instead just give the Administrator one. Another more unrelated thing is, that they suggest you give the Mention @everyone, @here and All Roles permission which is simply stupid. Another bad role model are large bots. Bots such as Dyno, Rythm or Mee6 often ask for Administrator (Sometimes even with any other permission in existance) in their OAuth2 invite, which is more than questionable. Those bots encourage laziness because now you don't have to bother with the permissions as a whole.","title":"Reason 2) Bad role models"},{"location":"posts/2021/09-28-bots-and-admin/#what-can-you-do-against-this","text":"You may now ask \"But what can/should I do against this?\" to which I have some answers.","title":"What can you do against this?"},{"location":"posts/2021/09-28-bots-and-admin/#duce-exemplum-lead-by-example","text":"If you're a bot developer, stop asking for Administrator in your bot's invite.

I made this blog post, so that people can give their feedback in form of a comment below through Disqus. Before I start... \u00b6 From my last discussion 2 I learned a few things, and want to make a few things clear here. I do not tolerate any comments with targeted hate towards individuals or groups such as Discord Staff Members or Discord itself. I can understand you being upset sometimes but it doesn't give you the freedom to insult or attack others. I will report any comment that can be considered insulting towards GitHub for breaking general rules such as Code of Conduct. I want the chat to be civilized and welcoming and not just a place to \"let off steam\", as good as it may be at first. Thank you. About \u00b6 Bots that are nearing 100 servers need to get verified by Discord to be allowed to join past 100 servers, but also to gain or keep access to specific, whitelisted intents such as Guild Members and Guild presences (And in future also Messages). While the whole intent thing is another can of worms I would like to tackle, I do not want to do this here and now. Instead would I like to talk about Discord's bot verification and how fundamentally broken it is to begin with. I will use some data I collected through a survey 3 I made. While the amount of responses I got is somewhat low (39 participants as of writing this), I still think it is valuable data to work with, mainly because there aren't really any official statistics from Discord themselves to work with. My post will mainly cover the \"Inorganic Growth\" issues that a lot of developers are encountering, and I will give my personal thoughts on this matter as well. Enjoy. The general issues with intents \u00b6 Discord's verification system has a few flaws and issues that I can't get behind. One of them being the whitelisted intents. It makes sense that you want to put sensitive intents behind a whitelist to not willingly give sensitive data to bots that could abuse it. The issue is that small bots still can access priviledged intents and data without the whitelisting. While this makes sense for bots that are only on a hand full of servers and are used for things like moderation is it not really covering the data from being exploited. While some of you may think that 100 servers isn't that much should you always remember that a server may have hundreds if not even thousands of individual members. This could end up in the bot having access to thousands of individual members without needing whitelisting for the intent to begin with. I'm not the biggest fan of the priviledged intents, since they caused my bot to lose a few very valuable features in the process, but if you really want to keep this should the intent requirement perhaps be lowered to like 50 servers as no person in the world has a private bot on over 100 servers. At such a point would it be a public bot already. The next problem is Discord's reason of \"privacy\". I remember Discord mentioning that the intents were restricted to prevent spam bots or data farms (Sites that collect and display user information without consent) from getting such information that easy. While this may be a good point, the fact that this only applies to bots makes it essentially pointless. Sites which collect data without consent of the users often don't use bots, but instead automated user accounts to do so, and as a result can collect the info without any restrictions because the Discord client does have the required intents to work properly. In addition, \"small\" bots can still do damage with those intents. How else do you explain the existence of all those \"Free nitro\" and \"Free server boosts\" bots? Finally, a bot is not infallible and can be hijacked at any moment. Yes, it may be unlikely, but it is not impossible, and if the bot is on several thousands of servers AND also has access to the intents could nobody predict what exploits could be done with the data received. After all are bot lists and other, larger servers facing almost weekly if not even daily DM spam from bots and automated users. Lots of flagging in verification \u00b6 The above graph shows the very first question of my survey, which was whether the dev's bot has been flagged for \"Inorganic Growth\". While the larger part ( 56.4% ) of people answered with a \"No\", we should not forget that this was indeed a simple \"Yes\"/\"No\" question, so the remaining 43.6% answered with a clear \"Yes\", which even for such a small amount of participants is quite a large number (17 people out of 39). But why is that? Well, there seems to be one common cause that I noticed and that is bot lists. Discord and Bot lists \u00b6 There seems to be a trend that bots, which are part of (larger) bot lists seem to get flagged more frequently. This kind of makes sense because a bot list increases a bot's rate of being invited to servers. One participant of the survey even linked a reddit post, in which they mentioned how their bot started to join dozens of servers a day after it was approved and added to a bot list. And this seems to be a big issue for Discord. For some reason do they not like it, when people add bots to bot lists and their system will flag the bot for \"Inorganic Growth\". While this is logical, since it's most likely an automated system that should flag bots having a sudden boost in invites per day, there are still people responsible for handling this flagging... And they are doing a horrible job at it. Copy-paste responses and no help \u00b6 In my survey, I also asked people whether they received a particular message when their appeal was rejected. Here is some important context regarding this particular question and graph. The above graph only depicts responses from devs which... Got their bot flagged for \"Inorganic Growth\" Made an appeal towards Discord Got their appeal denied This means that participants who did not get their bot flagged, did not appeal or got their appeal accepted are not included in this graph, since they're not relevant for that particular question. When we look at it can we see that 91.7% of participants responded with a \"Yes\". To put this in perspective: Only 1 single user out of 12 responded with \"No\" But what was the message you may now ask? Well, it was this one here: Unfortunately, our original findings have not changed. Your bot's growth pattern and server distribution remain concerning, though we cannot provide exact details on what prompted our concern. We will not be verifying this bot. This means that Discord, instead of giving any clear explanation as to what made the system flag their bot to begin with and why they won't accept the appeal, just gives a cookie-cutter response to justify this. Discord, why do you not want to give clear info? Do you really fear we may exploit that? People, especially developers are not the cliche hackers you may think we are. We want to improve and feedback to improve is a core part of this. If there is an issue with the bot, then we want to fix it. Giving some clear info as to what caused the concerns and flagging would allow devs to improve the bot by e.g. implementing an anti-bot-farm system. You force the devs to basically guess what the issue is and by that point, it seems like you blame bot lists for doing what they do which is promote and share Discord bots towards others. You at one point allow us to make and share bots, but on the other side don't allow us to share them with others through common ways including bot lists? Pick a side Discord. How can this be fixed? \u00b6 This is a big question: \"How to fix this mess?\" and... well... it can be difficult to answer. I do have one idea tho: Abolish the \"Inorganic Growth\" check This check so far did more harm than good. Many potentially good bots lost their right of showing what they can offer because an automated, faulty system thinks their growth was not legit and caused by the dev and because the staff behind that faulty system doesn't seem to care to even make some basic research and check if the bot is actually doing bad stuff. You shamelessly shift the blame to the dev, telling them that they are the ones at fault here because they did what anyone would do to promote a bot: Adding it to bot lists. YOU constantly promote devs and tell everyone how awesome the community is in building new things, but at the same time do you constantly put stones in our way and prevent bots from reaching potential. What if one of the denied bots could help servers with preventing phishing attacks? What if a bot could help people with mental or physical issues to easier connect to others in a server? We never know because you play doorman and keep them out of your place. Your motto is \"Imagine a place!\", but how should developers imagine anything if the way they can/should promote a bot is restricted by your rules? You want US to share our bots with the world, but when we do it through methods you don't own is it suddenly \"illegitimate\" and wrong. How are we supposed to share our bots? The \"Word by mouth\" aproach may work for some, but not all, bots, and a bot list is one of the most common ways to do so. It existed for years now and never was an issue, but now with your \"Inorganic Growth\" detection and what seems like to be a zero-tolerance rule, we are unable to share what we put our time and effort in. You - once again - destroy the community that started to make you big. Users aren't the only thing on your platforms. It's the bots that can and will bring life and changes to a server. Without bots we would not have a way to ban raiders (or to prevent raids to begin with because slowmode isn't the best solution here), detect and eliminate scam and phishing attempts, maintain channels, etc. Bots enhance the server and by blocking their growth through a faulty system \u2014 which you trust more than the individual people that spend hours on making the bot - you essentially dilute the bot place. Larger bots get more and more exposure and smaller ones stay low because daddy Discord says \"No\". Please start to change. Update your system and also accept that adding a bot to a bot list at its start is a common practice and shouldn't be treated as \"illegitimate\". You make devs and bot lists look like criminals, because of your horrible growth detection. If you care about privacy and security, actually do actions against bad actors in the community. Add a link detection that prevents sending of phishing links. If browsers can have such a detection, so Discord can have to. Rework your permission system to have easier ways to implement things like muting-systems, or even better, ADD a mute-system to mute a user server-wide, no matter their roles. Improve Audit-logs to include more info from what bots do, like deleting messages of others. You so far give very few info that can actually be useful for mods on a server to see what is happening. In general, start to actually fix stuff that really matters and don't punish bot devs for being human beings.

This is an update to my original Post In defense of SpigotMC . It contains some new info regarding Kangarko and why he's still a bad person. Just like the original post a year ago does this one not try to mention the \"courses\" Kangarko offers to not offer free advertisement in any way. A quick recap \u00b6 On the 20 th of december 2020 (Almost a year ago as of now) was the former Spigot member Kangarko removed from the SpigotMC Forums. The reasons were not publicly stated at first, but after he tried to blame SpigotMC on being at fault here did MD_5 make an announcement 1 , clarifying the actual reasons and the current situation. The reason he stated in that post was repeated violations of the forum rules, primarely abuse of the resource's update feature for promotional actions (i.e. advertisements). Kangarko, as of writing right now, still doesn't see himself at fault here and tries to play down the situation. A recent proof of this can be seen when viewing the repository ChatControl-Pro, which has the following header shown (Links have been removed to, again, not give free advertisement): README.md @ kangarko/ChatControl-Pro on GitHub We have left SpigotMC and continue ChatControl development here. Everyone gets a FREE upgrade, click this link to apply. The above statement is wrong on various levels. The main issue is, that the actual reason, which was that he got banned, hasn't been stated, and instead is he playing this as if HE was the person leaving, which is wrong. Kangarko today: False claims and bold lies \u00b6 Kangarko is known to some to cause drama, hate and perhaps even mental or physical damage. With that said are there still people that believe him blindly and do things like posting comments avdertising other platforms to get the plugin 2 . Other things are completely wrong statements he makes on various places. Take for example the banner he likes to paste everywhere he can, advertising his MA courses... This banner is stating that he is a \"Official JetBrains Partner\". When we, however, take a look at JetBrains Partner page 3 and search for either his course, the old name he had before, his commonly used name (Kangarko) or his real name (Matej) can we find absolutely nothing. I've reached out to JetBrains to see if there is any evidence that he is in fact an official partner with them, but other than a confirmation that they will investigate it, did I not get any answer so far. Other bold claims he makes are for example the \"2,000+ students\" and \"900+ reviews\". First of all is a large number not automatically a good thing. By that logic would Aids or even Corona be the best thing ever, but look where we are right now. Especially when we talk about reviews. From those 900+ reviews could only like half of it be good and the remainder could be a bad rating or sarcastic 5-star reviews. But knowing from personal experience that he likes to use reviews from his plugins 4 would I believe that not even half of those reviews are actual legit ones. Why do I bother? \u00b6 Now the question: Why do I even care that much? It wouldn't hurt me if others fall for him, so why bother about this? Because stupidity of others is no excuse to tolerate this. He does quite a few shitty things that I can't tolerate and staying silent is not something I really want to do here. He still gets people to fall for his shady tricks and I want to clear them up about this. I see it as a mission to help those that don't see the issues here. So if you know someone that believes Kangarko blindly, send them this post and the one I made almost a year ago and tell them to read it. It hopefully clears up their mind.

Kangarko, as of writing right now, still doesn't see himself at fault here and tries to play down the situation. A recent proof of this can be seen when viewing the repository ChatControl-Pro, which has the following header shown (Links have been removed to, again, not give free advertisement): README.md @ kangarko/ChatControl-Pro on GitHub We have left SpigotMC and continue ChatControl development here. Everyone gets a FREE upgrade, click this link to apply. The above statement is wrong on various levels. The main issue is, that the actual reason, which was that he got banned, hasn't been stated, and instead is he playing this as if HE was the person leaving, which is wrong.","title":"A quick recap"},{"location":"posts/2021/11-22-dont-trust-kangarko/#kangarko-today-false-claims-and-bold-lies","text":"Kangarko is known to some to cause drama, hate and perhaps even mental or physical damage. With that said are there still people that believe him blindly and do things like posting comments avdertising other platforms to get the plugin 2 . Other things are completely wrong statements he makes on various places. Take for example the banner he likes to paste everywhere he can, advertising his MA courses... This banner is stating that he is a \"Official JetBrains Partner\". When we, however, take a look at JetBrains Partner page 3 and search for either his course, the old name he had before, his commonly used name (Kangarko) or his real name (Matej) can we find absolutely nothing. I've reached out to JetBrains to see if there is any evidence that he is in fact an official partner with them, but other than a confirmation that they will investigate it, did I not get any answer so far. Other bold claims he makes are for example the \"2,000+ students\" and \"900+ reviews\". First of all is a large number not automatically a good thing. By that logic would Aids or even Corona be the best thing ever, but look where we are right now. Especially when we talk about reviews. From those 900+ reviews could only like half of it be good and the remainder could be a bad rating or sarcastic 5-star reviews. But knowing from personal experience that he likes to use reviews from his plugins 4 would I believe that not even half of those reviews are actual legit ones.","title":"Kangarko today: False claims and bold lies"},{"location":"posts/2021/11-22-dont-trust-kangarko/#why-do-i-bother","text":"Now the question: Why do I even care that much?

The folder structure of ItemsAdder has changed in v3.3.0! Please see this blog post for info on what has changed. In this blog post will I try my very best to teach you how to understand the general structure of ItemsAdder and how you can add your own custom Items (Either only with textures or with custom models). I want to mention that I will only cover the very basics of how to make items and blocks. I will not cover how to add custom durability, effects, sounds, etc. Refer to the ItemsAdder Wiki 1 for more info. General Structure \u00b6 First things first, what is the general structure of ItemsAdder? All important stuff is handled inside /plugins/ItemsAdder/ . When opening that folder is it first overwhelming given the amount of folders and files present. For our purposes will only the data/ folder be of importance to us, so you can discard the other folders and files for now. When opening the folder you will find two folders in it: items_packs/ and resource_pack items_packs \u00b6 This folder contains all the YAML files used to create custom items, blocks, furniture and similar. It's the main place for configuration that doesn't require altering of Model files. The general structure of this folder is as follows: items_packs/ | |- :namespace # This can be any name | | | |- some_file.yml | |- folder/ # additional folders are allowed | | | |- other_file.yml | |- z_iainternal/ | |- ... # Internal stuff used by ItemsAdder itself The structure is fairly simple, as its only purpose is to hold the configuration files and nothing more. resource_pack \u00b6 This folder contains all the necessary files to create a valid resource pack to use, including the final pack.zip file when using /iazip . You'll notice that this folder has a assets/ folder. Looking into said folder may reveal a structure similar to this one: resource_pack/ | |- assets/ | | | |- minecraft/ | | | | | |- ... # This contains Minecraft-related files | | | |- z_iainternal/ | | | |- ... # Internal stuff used by ItemsAdder itself | |- index.html |- pack.mcmeta If you ever worked with a resource pack before should the structure of resource_pack look familiar to you, especially with the pack.mcmeta present. This is because this folder is the final resource pack structure inside the Zip file, meaning that the structure in it mimics Minecraft's main structure. Creating a basic Item (2D Item) \u00b6 Let's quickly create a new item. It should just be a normal item with a special texture and no real feature. It's a good idea to first create the necessary folders for the textures and files to use. In my example will I use the name myitem as the namespace to use. This means that the folder structures may look like this: data/ | |- items_packs/ | | | |- myitem/ | |- resource_pack/ | |- assets/ | |- myitem/ As you can see do we create new folders called myitem inside items_packs and resource_pack/assets/ . The reason why resource_pack has it inside the assets folder is, that MC is always checking assets/:namespace/ for textures, models and similar when any given path is prefixed with a namespace (i.e. myitem:some/path ). The next step I usually do is to first add the assets. In our case would it just be a PNG file of the item. In this example am I calling it dummy.png . Since it is a texture will we need to add a textures folder inside the assets/myitem/ directory, as MC checks assets/:namespace/textures/ for any texture file. For better organisation will I also add an extra item/ folder to it. This means, that the new structure is like this: data/ | |- items_packs/ | | | |- myitem/ | |- resource_pack/ | |- assets/ | |- myitem/ | |- textures/ | |- item/ | |- dummy.png Pro-tips Keep file and folder names lowercased. Minecraft doesn't like uppercased names that much. You can always use extra folders inside the textures folder to further organize your files. Just make sure to also adjust any texture paths used. Now with this completed is the next step to actually tell ItemsAdder to add it as a new item. To do this, I create a new YAML file inside items_packs/myitem/ . Any name for the file works, but it should be kept lowercase and not contain any spaces or weird characters. To keep it simple will I name it dummy.yml and fill it with the following: dummy.yml info : namespace : myitem # (1) items : dummy : # (2) display_name : \"Dummy Item\" # (3) resource : material : PAPER # (4) generate : true # (5) textures : # (6) - 'item/dummy.png' This is used as the custom namespace for ItemsAdder commands such as /iaget but also other things This can be any name. Just make sure it's lowercased. It will be used as identifier for the custom item (i.e. myitem:dummy ) The name that will be displayed when obtaining the item. The Base item that is used. ItemsAdder will assign a custom model data for the item to override the texture/model. This has to be a valid Minecraft item. generate: true tells ItemsAdder to auto-generate the necessary model file for this item. This should be used if you're not using a custom model. This sets the textures to use. For a normal item is only one texture needed, but blocks can have up to 6 (One for each side). The path is relative to assets/:namespace/textures/ . With this setup am I telling ItemsAdder to create a new entry for the item PAPER with the texture located at assets/myitem/textures/ . After saving the changes can I now run /iazip to update the resource pack. Afterwards should I be able to get the item using /iaget myitem:dummy Creating a Block \u00b6 Creating a block is for the most part the same as creating an item so please read that part first. In this example am I using the same folder structure, with the difference that the PNG files for the block are inside assets/myitem/textures/block/ and that I'm using multiple ones. All we need to do now is add some extra stuff to it: dummy_block.yml info : namespace : myitem items : dummy_block : display_name : \"Dummy Block\" resource : material : PAPER # (1) generate : true textures : # (2) - 'block/dummy_down.png' - 'block/dummy_east.png' - 'block/dummy_north.png' - 'block/dummy_south.png' - 'block/dummy_up.png' - 'block/dummy_west.png' specific_properties : block : # (3) type : REAL_NOTE # (4) break_particle : ITEM # (5) It's recommended to use an item and not a block here, to avoid glitchy placement behaviour. The item will look like a block in the inventory. In this example am I setting individual textures for each side of the block. The order is actually important and the names should tell it. If each side has the same texture will you only need one texture to be set here. This tells ItemsAdder that this item should be placable like an actual block. This will also change the texture displayed in the Inventory to that of a full block. The type defines what Vanilla block should be used. Recommended is to use REAL_NOTE . What types are available can be found in the Wiki Sets the particle to use for when the block is broken. ITEM tells ItemsAdder to use the textures set for the item. This is already enough to create a custom block to use. All that is left is to update the resource pack ( /iazip ) and obtaining the item ( /iaget myitem:dummy_block ) Custom models (i.e. for furniture) \u00b6 There are cases where you want to create your own models for an item or a block 2 . Let's say we want to use a custom model for our dummy item. In order to do this will we first need to create the actual Model file to use. A recommended software to use for this is Blockbench 3 as it allows a relatively easy creation of MC block/item models. To not make this guide too long will I skip the entire model creation process. Just assume we still have the same Texture file in the same directory ( assets/myitem/textures/dummy.png ) and that we create a JSON model file which may look something similar to this: dumy_model.json { \"credit\": \"Made with Blockbench\", \"textures\": { \"0\": \"myitem:item/dummy\", \"particle\": \"myitem:item/dummy\" }, \"elements\": [ { // Here would be all the element parts of our model } ] } Important Model files follow the same structure with textures as MC does, meaning that you need to prefix the texture path with your namespace (in my case myitem: ) and also provide a path relative to assets/:namespace/textures/ . Additionally do you not have to append a .png extension to the paths. MC automatically assumes PNG files being used. Blockbench should deal with those things by itself, as long as you're using a proper folder structure for the textures. We would put this file into a new folder called models . To add more structure am I adding an extra folder called item , so the current structure would look similar to this: data/ | |- items_packs/ | | | |- myitem/ | | | |- dummy_item.yml | |- dummy_block.yml | |- resource_pack/ | |- assets/ | |- myitem/ | |- models/ # Newly added folder | | | |- item/ | | | |- dummy_model.json | |- textures/ | |- item/ | | | |- dummy.png | |- block/ | |- dummy_down.png |- dummy_east.png |- dummy_north.png |- dummy_south.png |- dummy_up.png |- dummy_west.png Since we just edit an existing item can we open the dummy_item.yml file and adjust a few things: dummy_item.yml info : namespace : myitem items : dummy : display_name : \"Dummy Item\" resource : material : PAPER generate : false model_path : \"item/dummy_model\" What you may have noticed is, that generate is set to false . This is important since we want to use our own model file and keeping this option set to true would cause ItemsAdder to still auto-generate and use its own model file, resulting in issues. Additionally, have I removed the textures option and instead added the model_path one. This is required to actually tell ItemsAdder where the model file is located. And since the model file already defines textures is this option no longer needed in the YAML file. You should now be able to update the resource pack with /iazip and get the newly modelled item. If the item is still the old one, clear the cache using the /iacleancache command. Footnotes https://itemsadder.devs.beer/ \u21a9 Custom blocks are bound to certain limitations. As an example can you not have open sites or transparent textures with REAL_NOTE or REAL blocks. This is due to Minecraft not rendering block faces that are covered by other blocks. And since MC doesn't know that our block isn't covering the full side will this result in an X-Ray effect. The usage of REAL_TRANSPARENT to bypass this effect is recommended. Tho it only allows fully opaque and fully transparent textures. No semi-transparent ones (So no custom coloured glass as an example). \u21a9 https://blockbench.net \u21a9","title":"Understand and create custom ItemsAdder Items"},{"location":"posts/2022/10-29-itemsadder/#general-structure","text":"First things first, what is the general structure of ItemsAdder?

Employees got fired or resigned, verified accounts lost their iconic blue checkmark and received a grey/transparent \"official\" badge while the blue checkmark is now something you can buy for $8, and other things I sure can't think of right now. But all this drama also surfaces some new changes. Mastodon 1 gained a lot of popularity due to the recent events and is currently having around 1.9 million active users on over 6,000 individual servers. People start to move from Twitter to Mastodon as they see the former dying in the forseeable future or at least becoming a less welcoming place for individuals. Since so many people switch to Mastodon are there obviously some that have a hard time understanding the inner workings of this platform (And federation in general), so with this post will I try my best to explain how to get started on Mastodon. The Basics first \u00b6 First, let us clear up what Mastodon actually is. Mastodon is a decentralized (aka federated) Micro-blogging platform. \"Federation? What is that?\" will you probably ask. In the most layman terms does federation mean, that a service, site, ... isn't controlled by a single company, group or individual. Instead are there multiple servers (so called instances) that communicate with each other, building a network. This has the benefit that this service or site isn't under the control of one individual and can't be shut down so easily. If one instance is blocked/shut down, several others continue to exist. Or to put it even more simply: Federation puts control into the hand of the people and not just a single person. Mastodon is using this concept. It allows everyone to create their own instance with its own settings, themes, rules, topics, etc. to then communicate with other instances in the so-called Fediverse (Federated Universe). How to use \u00b6 I'll now go about the basics of Mastodon, explaining in easy steps how you can use it properly. Keep in mind that those are things I learned myself, so there may be better options for this in the end. Registration \u00b6 Given the fact that there are multiple instances, you may think you have to make an account for each instance to do things like following an account , boosting or adding a post to your favourites , but that is not the case. On Mastodon do you only require a single account for the entire Fediverse. With that said is it sill important, where you want to register your account. Each instance has its own rules and also its own set of features. Some may support markdown, others may not. Some may allow all kinds of topics, others are only about certain ones. It all depends on your preferences and what you really want. A good site you may want to check is instances.social 2 which helps you finding the best matching instance based on your preferences. At the end of this post can you also find a list of my personal recommendations. Once you have selected the instance you want can you create your account. Depending on the instance will your account be ready right after you verified your e-mail, or may require approval of the staff of the instance. It's recommended to check the instance's /about page to see if they mention anything particular to look for. The moment your account is ready can you start posting. Tho you may first want to edit your profile (Avatar, Banner, Bio, Links) and preferences before actually doing that. Following an account \u00b6 Just like on Twitter can you follow individual accounts on Mastodon. Tho, due to how the federation works can it be a bit more difficult to do so. For accounts that are on the same instance is it relative easy: Go to their account page and press the \"Follow\" button. Accounts on other instances tho are a little bit more tricky, but not that much. First, find out on what instance they have their account. This can for once be checked through their tag. The full tag of a user is @username@domain.tld where domain.tld is the domain of the instance this account was made on. If, for example, you want to follow the Mastodon account on mastodon.social would the full tag be @Mastodon@mastodon.social . To now follow the user, copy the tag and append it to the URL of the instance you use. If the instance would be example.com , would the URL be example.com/@Mastodon@mastodon.social . This will now show the profile through your instance, allowing you to easily follow it. Note A user can set that follows need to be accepted by them first, before you can see their public posts in your feed. It's important to note that you can only see public posts from people you follow in your personal timeline. Mastodon doesn't provide nor use analytics to \"recommend\" posts to you. You have to find the stuff yourself. Reply to a post \u00b6 Replying is relatively easy. Posts made from accounts on the same instance can be replied to by just pressing the button, writing your reply and sending it. For posts on other instances is it a little bit more complicated... You first need to obtain the URL to the post (Example: example.com/@user/123456789 ). Next will you need to paste it into the search bar of your instance and press enter. If everything works well should it be displayed as a result that you can click on. You can now reply to it just how you can do it to posts from your instance. Boosting a post \u00b6 \"Boosting\" is Mastodon's term for \"Re-tweeting\", meaning that you re-post the message from someone (or yourself) into your own timeline of posts. Boosting follows a similar principle as replying to a post in a sense that you can just press the boost icon for posts from the same instance, but need to find the post through search for those from other instances. What is important to note is, that you can't quote a boosted message. You can only boost it as-is without modifications. This was an intentional decition made by the devs of Mastodon as quoted re-tweets usually end up in a lot of drama or other bad behaviours they didn't want on Mastodon. Adding posts to favourites \u00b6 \"Favouriting\" a post is the same as \"Liking\" a tweet on Twitter. Favouriting a post follows a similar principle as replying to a post in a sense that you can just press the Favourite icon for posts from the same instance, but need to find the post through search for those from other instances. Recommendations \u00b6 Here are a few personal recommendations for getting you started with Mastodon. Servers \u00b6 Note Descriptions are taken from the servers themself. tech.lgbt \u00b6 This Mastodon instance is for tech workers, academics, students, furries, and others interested in tech who are LGBTQIA+ or Allies. All are welcome to join us! craftodon.social \u00b6 English speaking non-official Minecraft instance. For everyone who plays Minecraft, this instance is a mast! blobfox.coffee \u00b6 A cozy instance for people that like blobfoxes and/or coffee. mastodon.social \u00b6 Registration is currently disabled. The original server operated by the Mastodon gGmbH non-profit Tools \u00b6 instances.social \u00b6 A site that helps you finding the instance most fitting for your interests and needs. fedifinder.glitch.me \u00b6 Requires you to authorize an App for Twitter This site helps you finding mastodon accounts of people you follow on Twitter (or that follow you there). crossposter.masto.donte.com.br \u00b6 Requires you to authorize an App for Twitter and Mastodon A tool allowing you to bridge Mastodon and Twitter. It can forward posts/tweets, boosts/re-tweets and replies from Mastodon to Twitter and/or vice-versa. Special thanks \u00b6 The Mastodon gGmbH for making Mastodon. The glitch-soc devs for making their fork of Mastodon with Markdown support. Ember for making blobfox.coffee, which I use.

Mastodon is a decentralized (aka federated) Micro-blogging platform. \"Federation? What is that?\" will you probably ask. In the most layman terms does federation mean, that a service, site, ... isn't controlled by a single company, group or individual. Instead are there multiple servers (so called instances) that communicate with each other, building a network. This has the benefit that this service or site isn't under the control of one individual and can't be shut down so easily. If one instance is blocked/shut down, several others continue to exist. Or to put it even more simply: Federation puts control into the hand of the people and not just a single person. Mastodon is using this concept. It allows everyone to create their own instance with its own settings, themes, rules, topics, etc. to then communicate with other instances in the so-called Fediverse (Federated Universe).","title":"The Basics first"},{"location":"posts/2022/11-18-mastodon/#how-to-use","text":"I'll now go about the basics of Mastodon, explaining in easy steps how you can use it properly.

Creating items has remained the same with the only difference being the new folder structure . To learn how to create custom items, blocks, etc. read my previous post about ItemsAdder: Understand and create custom ItemsAdder Items Structure \u00b6 ItemsAdder has a main folder called contents that contains all the configuration files and assets for the custom items, blocks, models, furnitures, etc. The structure may look confusing at first, but at closer inspection is it a lot easier to understand and use. Let's show a quick example using the _iainternal folder as an example 1 : contents/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 _iainternal/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 configs/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dictionaries/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 de.yml \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 en.yml \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 es.yml \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 fr.yml \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 it.yml \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 pt.yml \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 tr.yml \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 zh_cn.yml \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 lang_overwrite/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dyed.yml \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 merchant.yml \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 guis.yml \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 icons.yml \u2514\u2500\u2500 resourcepack/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 _iainternal/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 (ommited for simplicity) \u2514\u2500\u2500 pack.mcmeta # This is only part of _iainternal As you can see is the folder containing two main folders: configs and resourcepack configs is the equivalent to the previous items_packs folder, meaning it contains the YAML files to define your custom items, blocks, etc. to add. resourcepack is equal to the previous resource_pack folder, meaning it's the main place containing your assets. The structure is the same as the usual assets/namespace/... one, which means that resourcepack/example/texture/ is equal to assets/example/texture/ in a resource pack. How to migrate \u00b6 While ItemsAdder v3.3.0 supports the old folder structure is it still recommended to convert your old content to the new one. One thing you need to keep in mind is, that ItemsAdder no longer creates generated model files, meaning you can/should delete any auto_generated/ folder to save space. Migrating is relatively easy: Copy any YAML files and folders located at ItemsAdder/data/items_packs/namespace/ to ItemsAdder/contents/namespace/configs/ (Replace namespace with the respective namespace used). Copy any asset files and folders located at ItemsAdder/data/resource_pack/assets/namespace/ to ItemsAdder/contents/namespace/resourcepack/namespace/ (Replace namespace with the respective namespace used). Rename data to any name (i.e. data-old ) to prevent ItemsAdder from using the old folders. Remove any auto_generated folders to save disk-space. Important! z_iainternal was renamed to _iainternal so make sure to rename that folder to avoid duplicate files being generated. Also, update any use of z_iainternal in the YAML files, including ia_gui.yml in the ItemsAdder folder. Once you completed these steps should you be able to just /iazip everything to get the new resource pack. The new location of the resource pack is at ItemsAdder/output/generated.zip ItemsAdder will report any issues during the Zip file creation, so keep an eye out for those. Common issues \u00b6 Here is a list of common issues and how you could solve them. Image not found for font_image 'namespace:image'. assets/namespace/textures/path/image.png \u00b6 This error may happen if ItemsAdder is unable to find a font image defined in one of the YAML configurations (or in one of its own files such as ia_gui.yml ). Usually this happens if you renamed a folder, but didn't update any files mentioning the font image with the old namespace. So, to fix it, check any files that may use the old namespace and update them. Invalid character in folders/name of file: /contents/namespace/resourcepack/namespace/textures/path/image.png \u00b6 This error is given whenever invalid characters are used in a file or folder path. Common invalid characters are: Uppercase letters (i.e. textures/someFolder/image.png ) Spaces (i.e. textures/path/invalid image name.png ) Non alphanummeric characters (\u00e0, \u00e9, \u00e8, etc.) To fix this, simply remove or replace invalid characters with accepted ones (alphanummeric characters (a-z, 0-9), hyphens (-) and underscores (_)). Remember to also check any YAML or model files that may use the path and/or file names and correct those too. File compression skipped: duplicate entry: assets/path/file.json \u00b6 This error means that a file with the exact same name and exact same location already exists in the provided folder and that ItemsAdder skipped any attempts at compressing (minifying) it. This usually only happens with Minecraft files. If you're sure that these files are only from ItemsAdder (Have been generated by it on older versions) can you safely delete them. Otherwise, leave them in to avoid any issues.
